# Floppy Disk

The HP4952A analyzer has a 3.5" floppy disk drive.

It ships with a plastic drive-head-protector!

Disks use the ["LIF" format](https://www.hp9845.net/9845/projects/hpdir/#lif_filesystem) common on Hewlett-Packard systems.  This is a different disk format than DOS, but there are good utilities for working with LIF disks and images.

There are two versions of the LIF utilities,
* [Tony Duell's original](http://www.hpcc.org/datafile/hpil/lif_utils.html), and
* [An extended fork by Joachim Siebold](https://github.com/bug400/lifutils)
